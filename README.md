## What is ERP and why do you need it?
ERP is an acronym that stands for enterprise resource planning.
It's a business process management software that manages and integrates a company's financials,
supply chain,operations,reporting,manufacturing and human resource activities.
Most companies have some form of finance and operational system in place but most of the software that's out there can't go beyond everyday business processes 
or help with future business growth.
